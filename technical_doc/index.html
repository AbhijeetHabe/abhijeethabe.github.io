                        Besides the while statement just introduced, Python uses the usual flow control statements 
                        known from other languages, with some twists. Those are as follows:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>if Statements</li>
                        <li>for Statements</li>
                        <li>break and continue Statements, and else Clauses on Loops</li>
                        <li>pass Statements</li>
                        <li>match Statements</li>
                    </ul>
                </section>
                <section class="main-section" id="if_Statements">
                    <header>if Statements</header>
                    <p>
                        Perhaps the most well-known statement type is the if statement. For example:
                    </p>
                        <code>
                            x = int(input("Please enter an integer: "))
                            Please enter an integer: 42
                            if x < 0:
                                x = 0
                                print('Negative changed to zero')
                            elif x == 0:
                                print('Zero')
                            elif x == 1:
                                print('Single')
                            else:
                                print('More') 
                        </code>
                    <p>
                        There can be zero or more elif parts, and the else part is optional. The keyword ‘elif’ is 
                        short for ‘else if’, and is useful to avoid excessive indentation. An if … elif … elif … 
                        sequence is a substitute for the switch or case statements found in other languages.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If you’re comparing the same value to several constants, or checking for specific types or 
                        attributes, you may also find the match statement useful.
                    </p>

                        The for statement in Python differs a bit from what you may be used to in C or Pascal.
                        Rather than always iterating over an arithmetic progression of numbers (like in Pascal), or 
                        giving the user the ability to define both the iteration step and halting condition (as C), 
                        Python’s for statement iterates over the items of any sequence (a list or a string), in the 
                        order that they appear in the sequence. For example (no pun intended):
                    </p>
                    <code>
                        # Measure some strings:
                        words = ['cat', 'window', 'defenestrate']
                        for w in words:
                            print(w, len(w))

                        cat 3
                        window 6
                        defenestrate 12
                    </code>
                    <p>
                        Code that modifies a collection while iterating over that same collection can be tricky to get 
                        right. Instead, it is usually more straight-forward to loop over a copy of the collection or to 
                        create a new collection:
                    </p>
                    <code>
                        # Create a sample collection
                        users = {'Hans': 'active', 'Éléonore': 'inactive', '景太郎': 'active'}

                        # Strategy:  Iterate over a copy
                        for user, status in users.copy().items():
                            if status == 'inactive':
                                del users[user]

                        # Strategy:  Create a new collection
                        active_users = {}
                        for user, status in users.items():
                            if status == 'active':
                                active_users[user] = status
                    </code>

                    <header>
                        break Statements

                        The break statement, like in C, breaks out of the innermost enclosing for or while loop.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Loop statements may have an else clause; it is executed when the loop terminates through 
                        exhaustion of the iterable (with for) or when the condition becomes false (with while), but 
                        not when the loop is terminated by a break statement. This is exemplified by the following 
                        loop, which searches for prime numbers:
                    </p>
                    <code>
                        for n in range(2, 10):
                        for x in range(2, n):
                            if n % x == 0:
                                print(n, 'equals', x, '*', n//x)
                                break
                        else:
                            # loop fell through without finding a factor
                            print(n, 'is a prime number')

                        2 is a prime number
                        3 is a prime number
                        4 equals 2 * 2
                        5 is a prime number
                        6 equals 2 * 3
                        7 is a prime number
                        8 equals 2 * 4
                        9 equals 3 * 3
                    </code>
                    <p>
                        (Yes, this is the correct code. Look closely: the else clause belongs to the for loop, not the 
                        if statement.)
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When used with a loop, the else clause has more in common with the else clause of a try 
                        statement than it does with that of if statements: a try statement’s else clause runs when 
                        no exception occurs, and a loop’s else clause runs when no break occurs. For more on the 
                        try statement and exceptions, see Handling Exceptions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The continue statement, also borrowed from C, continues with the next iteration of the loop:
                    </p>
                    <code>
                        for num in range(2, 10):
                        if num % 2 == 0:
                            print("Found an even number", num)
                            continue
                        print("Found an odd number", num)

                        Found an even number 2
                        Found an odd number 3
                        Found an even number 4
                        Found an odd number 5
                        Found an even number 6
                        Found an odd number 7
                        Found an even number 8
                        Found an odd number 9
                    </code>
                </section>
                <section class="main-section" id="pass_Statements">
                    <header>pass Statements</header>
                    <p>
                        The pass statement does nothing. It can be used when a statement is required syntactically 
                        but the program requires no action. For example:
                    </p>
                    <code>
                        while True:
                            pass  # Busy-wait for keyboard interrupt (Ctrl+C)
                    </code>
                    <p>
                        This is commonly used for creating minimal classes:
                    </p>
                    <code>
                        class MyEmptyClass:
                            pass
                    </code>
                    <p>
                        Another place pass can be used is as a place-holder for a function or conditional body when 
                        you are working on new code, allowing you to keep thinking at a more abstract level. The 
                        pass is silently ignored:
                    </p>
                    <code>
                        def initlog(*args):
                            pass   # Remember to implement this!
                    </code>
                </section>
                <section class="main-section" id="match_Statements">
                    <header>match Statements</header>
                    <p>
                        A match statement takes an expression and compares its value to successive patterns given 
                        as one or more case blocks. This is superficially similar to a switch statement in C, Java or 
                        JavaScript (and many other languages), but it’s more similar to pattern matching in languages 
                        like Rust or Haskell. Only the first pattern that matches gets executed and it can also extract 
                        components (sequence elements or object attributes) from the value into variables.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The simplest form compares a subject value against one or more literals:
                    </p>
                    <code>
                        def http_error(status):
                            match status:
                                case 400:
                                    return "Bad request"
                                case 404:
                                    return "Not found"
                                case 418:
                                    return "I'm a teapot"
                                case _:
                                    return "Something's wrong with the internet"
                    </code>
                    <p>
                        Note the last block: the “variable name” _ acts as a wildcard and never fails to match. If no 
                        case matches, none of the branches is executed.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You can combine several literals in a single pattern using | (“or”):
                    </p>
                    <code>
                        case 401 | 403 | 404:
                            return "Not allowed"
                    </code>
                    <p>
                        Patterns can look like unpacking assignments, and can be used to bind variables:
                    </p>
                    <code>
                        # point is an (x, y) tuple
                        match point:
                            case (0, 0):
                                print("Origin")
                            case (0, y):
                                print(f"Y={y}")
                            case (x, 0):
                                print(f"X={x}")
                            case (x, y):
                                print(f"X={x}, Y={y}")
                            case _:
                                raise ValueError("Not a point")
